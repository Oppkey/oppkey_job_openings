# Vecnos Video Editor

Vecnos produces the award-winning IQUI 360 degree camera, made for people who want to show off the world around them from a fun, unique perspective. With easy editing and quick sharing on social media. 

* Create reusable intro and outro for series of IQUI-focused videos
* Create video showing off new Magic feature. It uses AI to find all faces within the 360 degree image, and then creates a mini video spinning from face to face. Show how to set it up with a screencast of the step within the app, and show 3 examples of how it can be used (1) around a dinner table, (2) hiking with friends in the mountains, and (3) at a birthday party.
* Create video showing off new Beauty feature. Requires finding 3 different subjects to show their faces within a 360 degree image, and show the Before and After, so that the smoothing and sharpening of facial features is shown off clearly.
* Create video showing how to take a "Screenshot," which is just using the part of the 360 degree image that you can see on your phone.
* Create video showing off the Top 5 filters, and describe in what situations they work best.
* Create video showing off the Templates, and how they are a good "jumping off point," but can be fully customized by changing Effects and Motions.
