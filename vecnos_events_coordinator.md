# Vecnos Events Coordinator

Vecnos produces the award-winning IQUI 360° camera, made for people who want to show off the world around them from a fun, unique perspective. We will be doing events in the Bay Area, depending on health regulations, and need help with organizing events, promotion, and on-site staffing.

* Brainstorm and create themes for events. For example, “Take a 360° selfie for free ice cream”
* Scout venues, scope out on-site materials needs (tables, opt-in contact recording, power supplies, back up cameras)
* Scope out signage and printing requirements, if needed
* Create promotional plan
* Show convincing demos of IQUI
* Be able to answer questions about connecting to your smartphone, taking pictures, editing using the IQUISPIN app
* Some weekend or evening hours for event times may be required
